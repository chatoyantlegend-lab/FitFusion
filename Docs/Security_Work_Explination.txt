This folder contains my individual cybersecurity work for the FitFusion project.

Pages:
- SecurityTestPage.xaml / .cs
  A UI page designed to test input validation and sanitization.
  It allows users to enter username, email, password, and goals,
  demonstrating how unsafe input is handled securely.

Services:
- InputValidator.cs
  Handles validation rules such as required fields, email format,
  and password strength.

- InputSanitizer.cs
  Cleans user input by removing potentially malicious characters,
  reducing risks such as injection attacks.

This work was developed independently to practice secure coding,
input validation, defensive programming, and error handling.
